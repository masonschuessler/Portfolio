			<h1>Stress relief tips</h1>
			<p class="tips">Here are five tips that can help you 
				relieve stress on a daily basis.</p>
				<img src="../images/break.jpg" class="relief_tips" alt="">
			<h2>Take a break from what you're doing</h2>
			<p>Maybe it's hard to get away from a big work project, 
				a crying baby or a growing credit card bill. But give 
				yourself permission to step away from it for a short 
				time. Don't avoid your stressors (those bills have to 
				be paid sometime), but take a few minutes for yourself.</p>

			<h2>Exercise on a regular basis</h2>
			<p>Exercise is a huge part of being healthy, and it benefits 
				your mind as well as your body. It doesn't have to be an 
				hour a day; even a 20-minute walk in the midst of a stressful 
				time can give you an immediate effect that can last for several 
				hours.
			</p>
				<img src="../images/smile.jpg" class="relief_tips" alt="">
			<h2>Take time to smile and laugh</h2>
			<p>When people are stressed, they often hold a lot of the stress 
				in their face. Laughs and smiles can help relieve some of that 
				tension and improve the situation. And if you share your smile 
				with someone else, it will them release some of their tension 
				too!
			</p>
				<img src="../images/support.jpg" class="relief_tips" alt="">
			<h2>Get support from family and friends</h2>
			<p>Call a friend, send an email. Sharing your concerns does help 
				relieve stress. But pick a person who you feel can understand 
				you. If your co-workers are the stressors, it probably won't 
				alleviate your stress if you share your worries over credit 
				card bills with one of them.
			</p>
				<img src="../images/meditate.jpg" class="relief_tips" alt="">
			<h2>Meditate</h2>
			<p>Meditation helps the mind and body to relax and focus. When 
				meditating, people can release emotions that may have been 
				causing the body physical stress. Research has shown that even 
				meditating briefly can reap immediate benefits.</p>
