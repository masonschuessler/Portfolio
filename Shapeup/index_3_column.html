            As fitness expert Amanda Russell said:
            <blockquote>Fitness is about so much more than exercise.
                 Itâ€™s a catalyst for positive change, and it affects every aspect of your life.</blockquote>

            <h2>How to prepare to Shape Up!</h2>

            <h3>Get a check up</h3>
            <p>If you have any health issues or take any medications, be
             sure to consult with your healthcare provider before beginning
              a new exercise or diet regimen.</p>

            <h3>Dress for Success</h3>
            <p>Workout clothes should be comfy. While exercising, you should be
             thinking about what you're doing, not what you're wearing. That
              includes good shoes, which are essential for running, jogging,
               or walking, and socks that absorb shock and sweat.</p>

            <h3>Equipment?</h3>
            <p>You don't need to buy a lot of fancy equipment to get in shape. 
            But you might want to invest in a yoga mat, a large exercise ball,
             or some weights, depending on your Shape Up! plan.</p>

            <h3>Resist Temptation</h3>
            <p>It's hard to eat right when everyone else is buying lunch at a fast
             food restaurant. Invest in some good food containers and bring your
              healthy lunch and snacks. Your body and your wallet will thank you.</p>
